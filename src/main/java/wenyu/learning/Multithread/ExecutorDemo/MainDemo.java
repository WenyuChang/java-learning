 * between the task being done by a new thread, as defined by 
 * its Runnable object, and the thread itself, as defined by 
 * a Thread object. This works well for small applications, but 
 * in large-scale applications, it makes sense to separate thread 
 * management and creation from the rest of the application. 
 * Objects that encapsulate these functions are known as executors.
