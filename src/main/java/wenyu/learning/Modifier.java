	 * 10. NATIVE: The native keyword is applied to a method to indicate that 
	 * 			  the method is implemented in native code using JNI.
	 * 11. STRICTFP: The strictfp keyword may be applied to both classes and methods. 
	 * 				 For classes (and interfaces), it specifies that all of the expressions 
	 * 				 in all of the methods of the class are FP-strict. For methods, it 
	 * 				 specifies that all of the expressions in that method are FP-strict. 
	 * 				 So, what the heck does FP-strict really mean? For the full, gory details check 
	 *				 out section 2.18 of Lindholm and Yellin's The Java Virtual Machine 
	 *				 Specification Second Edition. If you do not specify strictfp then 
	 *				 the compiler & runtime system may be more aggressive in how they 
	 *				 deal with floating-point expressions. Whereas with strictfp specified, 
	 *				 the compiler and runtime system must toe the line very precisely 
	 *				 according to the IEEE-754 floating-point specification.
	 * 12. INTERFACE
